<h1>Using Astarte Channels</h1>
<p>Especially when building Frontend applications, it is useful to receive real-time updates about data sent from Devices. Astarte leverages <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Phoenix Channels</a> to provide such a thing over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> in AppEngine API. WebSockets can be used natively from a Web Browser and follow the same authentication pattern as a standard HTTP call.</p>
<p>Astarte Channels define a semantic on top of Phoenix Channels which allows read-only monitoring of <code class="inline">device</code> Interfaces. Authentication and Authorization over Channels happens in the very same way as <code class="inline">AppEngine</code>, and the <code class="inline">a_ch</code> claim in the token is respected when joining rooms and installing triggers. See <a href="070-auth.html">Authentication and Authorization</a> for more details on Auth semantics in Astarte.</p>
<h2 id="rooms" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#rooms" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Rooms
</h2>

<p>Rooms in Astarte Channels map 1:1 to Topics in Phoenix Channels, and can be joined in the very same way. Once a connection is established, the user can join any number of rooms, given he is <a href="#authorization">authorized to do so</a>.</p>
<p>A Room is identified by a topic with the following semantics: <code class="inline">rooms:&lt;realm&gt;:&lt;name&gt;</code>. For example, <code class="inline">rooms:test:myroom</code> will join the Room <code class="inline">myroom</code> in the Realm <code class="inline">test</code>.</p>
<p>A room can be joined by any number of concurrent users. Rooms serve as containers for Transient Triggers, which can be installed by any authorized user. Transient Triggers are actual <a href="060-triggers.md">Triggers</a>, with the difference that they exist within a Channels Room rather than within a Realm - this mostly affects their timespan - and that the <code class="inline">action</code> can&#39;t be configured - every time a Condition is triggered a message is delivered to users in the Room, <a href="https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_core/tree/master/lib/astarte_core/triggers/simple_events">in a well-known format</a>.</p>
<h3 id="events" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#events" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Events
</h3>

<p>Everytime a Condition of an installed Trigger is triggered, an event is sent to the Phoenix Channel, with a similar payload:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{
    &quot;device_id&quot;: &quot;f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;,
    &quot;event&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;device_connected&quot;,
        &quot;device_ip_address&quot;: &quot;1.2.3.4&quot;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><code class="inline">device_id</code> is always present (as long as the trigger matches a device) and identifies the device emitting the event. <code class="inline">event</code>, instead, depends on the kind of installed trigger. It always carries a <code class="inline">type</code> string, which identifies the content of the object. Currently, the documentation of every event&#39;s payload can be found in <a href="https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_core/tree/master/lib/astarte_core/triggers/simple_events">Astarte&#39;s protobuf files</a>. However, there are some discrepancies in mapping (e.g.). It is advised also to have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte_core/blob/master/lib/astarte_core/triggers/simple_events/encoder.ex">encoder</a>. In the foreseeable future, more user friendly documentation will be provided.</p>
<h3 id="lifecycle" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#lifecycle" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Lifecycle
</h3>

<p>Once a room is created, it remains valid and active with all of its subscriptions. There&#39;s little overhead in having a large number of rooms, as the only components leeching resources are Transient Triggers. As of today, Transient Triggers never expire - it is responsibility of the user to clean them up once the room becomes empty, if needed. In future versions, Transient Triggers will likely expire after some time, if left in an empty room.</p>
<h2 id="managing-transient-triggers" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#managing-transient-triggers" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Managing Transient Triggers
</h2>

<p>To install a Transient Trigger, one should issue a <code class="inline">watch</code> event in the Channel, given he is authorized to do so. The payload of such an event is identical to a Trigger definition, hence it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;datatrigger&quot;,
    &quot;device_id&quot;: &quot;f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;,
    &quot;simple_trigger&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;data_trigger&quot;,
        &quot;on&quot;: &quot;incoming_data&quot;,
        &quot;interface_name&quot;: &quot;org.astarteplatform.Values&quot;,
        &quot;interface_major&quot;: 0,
        &quot;match_path&quot;: &quot;/realValue&quot;,
        &quot;value_match_operator&quot;: &quot;&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;known_value&quot;: 0.6
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This installs in the Room a Transient Trigger which will trigger an event everytime a value higher than <code class="inline">0.6</code> is sent on the path <code class="inline">/realValue</code> of the <code class="inline">datastream</code> interface <code class="inline">org.astarteplatform.Values</code> by the device <code class="inline">f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA</code>, and will be received by every user currently in the room. If a user isn&#39;t in the room at the time of the event, he will not get it, and there&#39;s no way he can retrieve it if he joined at a later time.</p>
<p>Triggers can be uninstalled by issuing an <code class="inline">unwatch</code> event in the Channel. The payload of the event should be the name of the trigger which should be uninstalled.</p>
<h2 id="authorization" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#authorization" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Authorization
</h2>

<p>Just like any other Astarte component, Authorization is encapsulated in a token claim, in particular the <code class="inline">a_ch</code> claim. However, the mechanism is rather different compared to a REST API, and uses different verbs.</p>
<h3 id="join" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#join" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  JOIN
</h3>

<p>The <code class="inline">JOIN</code> verb implies that a user can join a room. This only allows him to receive events and to interact in a <em>read-only</em> fashion with the room itself. There is no restriction to which events a user sees - if he is authorized to enter in a room, he will be capable of seeing all events flowing in. More granular permissions can be done simply by creating more rooms in which different triggers will be installed.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">JOIN</code> verb has the following semantic: <code class="inline">JOIN::&lt;regex&gt;</code>, where regex matches a room name (the room name is what follows <code class="inline">rooms:&lt;realm&gt;:</code> - the realm is implicit in the context of the authorization token). For example, a user authorized with the <code class="inline">JOIN::test.*</code> claim in the <code class="inline">test</code> realm will be able to join, for example, <code class="inline">rooms:test:testthis</code>, <code class="inline">rooms:test:testme</code>, <code class="inline">rooms:test:test</code>. The realm is always implicit in the regex, as the token is authenticated in the context of a Realm.</p>
<h3 id="watch" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#watch" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  WATCH
</h3>

<p>The <code class="inline">WATCH</code> verb allows a user to install a Trigger within a room. Its semantics define which kind of trigger, and upon which entities the user is allowed to act. Watch semantics are <code class="inline">WATCH::&lt;regex&gt;</code>, where <code class="inline">regex</code> is a regular expression which matches a device, path or interface (or a mixture of them) in almost very same fashion as the <code class="inline">a_aea</code> claim (which is used in AppEngine).</p>
<p>Given different kind of triggers impact different Astarte entities, the Authorization claim implicitly defines which kind of triggers a user will be able to install. For example, <code class="inline">f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA/org.astarteplatform.Values.*</code> will allow installing data triggers such as the one shown in the previous example, but won&#39;t let the user install device-wide triggers (such as connect/disconnect events). A claim such as <code class="inline">f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA</code> or <code class="inline">f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAA.*</code>, instead, will allow device-level triggers to be installed.</p>

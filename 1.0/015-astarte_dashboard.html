<h1>Astarte Dashboard</h1><p>Astarte provides a built-in UI that can be used for managing Interfaces, Devices, and Triggers. The
Dashboard simplifies the development phases of applications that make use of Astarte, as well as
troubleshooting activities.</p><p>You can browse the source code of the Dashboard software on its
<a href="https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-dashboard">GitHub repository</a>.</p><h2 id="introduction" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#introduction" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Introduction
</h2>
<p>The Astarte Dashboard is a Single Page Application that provides users with an overview of their
Realm and a user-friendy way of managing it on any web browser. The Dashboard is designed to be a
quick and easy way to give you immediate feedback on your work and as a quick and intuitive way to
configure your realm. It is not designed to be operated by end-users, rather by infrastructure
maintainers, owners who need information on the system status, and those working on projects based
on Astarte. It is shipped by default with the Astarte standard distribution.</p><p>The Dashboard is a graphical client for Astarte APIs; it shares similar features with the CLI client
<a href="https://github.com/astarte-platform/astartectl">astartectl</a>, the command-line utility to manage
Astarte.</p><p>The Dashboard helps you manage:</p><ul><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#triggers">Triggers</a></li><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#interfaces">Interfaces</a></li><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#devices">Devices</a></li><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#groups">Groups</a></li><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#realm-settings">Realm Settings</a></li></ul><p>In case your Astarte distribution comes packaged with the
<a href="https://docs.astarte-platform.org/flow/snapshot">Flow framework</a>, the Dashboard is probably
configured to manage Flow resources as well.</p><ul><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#blocks">Blocks</a></li><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#pipelines">Pipelines</a></li><li><a href="015-astarte_dashboard.html#flows">Flows</a></li></ul><p>Please note that the Flow framework is not available for use in a docker-compose environment since
it relies on Kubernetes APIs to operate.</p><h3 id="how-to-access-it" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#how-to-access-it" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  How to access it
</h3>
<p>Depending on how you are using Astarte, here is where you can find the Dashboard:</p><ul><li>Docker-compose: if you are using a local instance of Astarte via <code class="inline">docker-compose</code>, you will find
it by pointing your browser to the default address <code class="inline">http://localhost:4040/</code>. To login, fill in the
name of your realm and a valid JWT token: if you possess the realm private key, as it is the case
if you followed the <a href="010-astarte_in_5_minutes.html">Astarte in 5 minutes</a> guide, you can generate
the token with the command <code class="inline">astartectl utils gen-jwt all-realm-apis -k &lt;private_key&gt;</code>.</li><li>Astarte Cloud: if you are using our managed Astarte option, you can hop onto our
<a href="https://console.astarte.cloud/realms">Console</a>, find or create your realm and click the Dashboard
button.</li><li>Kubernetes cluster: in this case, if the Dashboard is enabled, it can be usually found at
<code class="inline">dashboard.&lt;base Astarte URL&gt;</code>. Refer to your system administrator for more details.</li></ul><h2 id="main-overview" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#main-overview" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Main overview
</h2>
<p>Upon successful login, the main screen is the home page that provides an overview of the realm
status and resources.</p><p><img src="assets/astarte-dashboard-realm-overview.png" alt="Astarte Dashboard with a realm overview"/></p><h3 id="api-status" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#api-status" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  API Status
</h3>
<p>The API Status gives you general information about the status of services:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Realm Management</strong> is an <em>administrator-like</em> API for configuring a Realm. It is used for
managing Interfaces and Triggers.</p></li><li><p><strong>AppEngine</strong> is Astarte's main API endpoint for end-users. AppEngine exposes a RESTful API to
retrieve and send data from/to devices, according to their interfaces. Every direct device
interaction can be done from here. It also exposes Channels, a WebSocket-based solution for
listening to device events in real-time with the same mechanism and semantics used by Triggers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pairing</strong> takes care of Device Authentication and Authorization. It interacts with Astarte's CA
and orchestrates the way devices connect and interact with Transports. It also handles Device
Registration. Agent, Device and Pairing interaction is described in detail
<a href="050-pairing_mechanism.html">here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flow</strong> is the API endpoint for Astarte Flow, used for managing Blocks, Pipelines, and Flows.</p></li></ul><p>Possible statuses are:</p><ol><li>This service is operating normally.</li><li>This service appears offline.</li></ol><p>A general status on API health is also present in the app's sidebar, thus always providing a
feedback regardless of which page you are currently visiting.</p><h3 id="realm-resources" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#realm-resources" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Realm resources
</h3>
<p>Within the main overview, a brief summary is available as well for the existing resources of the
realm: registered and connected devices, installed interfaces, and installed triggers.</p><p>More detailed overviews of each resource are available in the dedicated Dashboard sections,
accessible via the navigation links in the Dashboard's side menu.</p><h2 id="interfaces" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#interfaces" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Interfaces
</h2>
<p><a href="030-manage_interfaces.html">Interfaces</a> are a core concept of Astarte which defines how data is
exchanged between Astarte and its peers.</p><p>You can navigate to this section thanks to the side menu of the Dashboard. A list of all installed
interfaces is displayed, together with their major versions.</p><p><img src="assets/astarte-dashboard-interfaces.png" alt="Astarte Dashboard, interface list"/></p><h3 id="installing-interfaces" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#installing-interfaces" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Installing interfaces
</h3>
<p>From the Interface list, clicking on the <strong>Install a new interface</strong> button will load up the
<strong>Interface Editor</strong>, an interactive tool that you can use to configure your interfaces.</p><p>The Interface Editor provides you with two ways to define your interfaces: on the left panel, a
graphical frontend, while on the right panel you may input a JSON definition to achieve the same
result. Each panel updates automatically whenever the other is changed.</p><p><img src="assets/astarte-dashboard-interface-editor.png" alt="Astarte Dashboard, Interface Editor"/></p><p>While defining a new interface, the Interface Editor will help you in supplying the right options
and filling in mandatory entries such as:</p><ul><li>Name: an arbitrary name, formatted in reversed DNS casing.</li><li>Major and Minor versions: based on <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</li><li>Type: indicates whether data is streamed continuously (<code class="inline">datastream</code>) or is stateful and persistent
(<code class="inline">properties</code>).</li><li>Ownership: the write-only allowed actor. All the other actors are read-only.</li><li>Mappings: a list of endpoints that represent the data structure, following REST controller
semantics.</li></ul><p>You can learn more about Interface definitions in their
<a href="030-interface.html">documentation's section</a>.</p><p>Note that when creating interface drafts, or for testing purposes in general, it is recommended to
use <code class="inline">0</code> as the major version: to prevent data loss, Astarte allows only interfaces where
<code class="inline">major_version</code> equals <code class="inline">0</code> to be deleted.</p><h3 id="managing-interfaces" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#managing-interfaces" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Managing interfaces
</h3>
<p>From the Interface list, you can select an interface to load and view its details in the Interface
Editor. Clicking on the name of the interface will select its latest revision; clicking on a
specific major of the interface will select the latest revision for that major. Note that interface
revisions follow the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> convention.</p><p>Once the Interface Editor is loaded you can review, update or delete the definition of the
interface.</p><p>Note that to prevent data loss, Astarte allows only interfaces where <code class="inline">major_version</code> equals <code class="inline">0</code> to
be deleted.</p><p>For similar reasons, when updating the definition of an interface, the Interface Editor will not
allow you to change core properties on a <code class="inline">minor</code> version update. If you need to apply substantial
changes, you can define and install a new <code class="inline">major</code> version for the interface.</p><h2 id="triggers" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#triggers" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Triggers
</h2>
<p><a href="060-using_triggers.html">Triggers</a> in Astarte are the go-to mechanism for generating push events.</p><p>You can navigate to this section thanks to the side menu of the Dashboard. A list of all installed
triggers is displayed.</p><p><img src="assets/astarte-dashboard-triggers.png" alt="Astarte Dashboard, trigger list"/></p><h3 id="installing-triggers" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#installing-triggers" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Installing triggers
</h3>
<p>From the Trigger list, clicking on the <strong>Install a new trigger</strong> button will load up the <strong>Trigger
Editor</strong>, an interactive tool that you can use to configure your triggers. It works in a very
similar fashion to Interface Editor and shares the same User Interface.</p><p>The Trigger Editor provides you with two ways to define your triggers: on the left panel, a
graphical frontend, while on the right panel you may input a JSON definition to achieve the same
result. Each panel updates automatically whenever the other is changed.</p><p>The graphical tool dynamically loads installed Interfaces in the Realm and eases trigger creation by
providing not only linting and validation, but also dynamic resolution of Interface names.</p><p><img src="assets/astarte-dashboard-trigger-editor.png" alt="Astarte Dashboard, Trigger Editor"/></p><p>You can learn more about Trigger definitions in their <a href="060-triggers.html">documentation's section</a>.</p><p>Note that due to how triggers work, you should install the trigger before a device connects. Doing
otherwise will cause the trigger to kick in at a later time, and as such no events will be streamed
for a while.</p><h3 id="managing-triggers" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#managing-triggers" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Managing triggers
</h3>
<p>From the Trigger list, you can select a trigger to load and view its details in the Trigger Editor.</p><p>Once the Trigger Editor is loaded you can review the definition of the trigger.</p><p>You can also delete the trigger instance by clicking on the <strong>Delete trigger</strong> button.</p><h2 id="devices" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#devices" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Devices
</h2>
<p>Devices are Astarte's main entities for exchanging data.</p><p>You can navigate to this section thanks to the side menu of the Dashboard. A list of all registered
devices is displayed.</p><p><img src="assets/astarte-dashboard-devices.png" alt="Astarte Dashboard, device list"/></p><p>Each device in the list is displayed together with info regarding its <em>status</em> and the <em>last
connection event</em>. The status is represented by a grey dot if the device never connected to Astarte,
a green dot if it is currently connected, a red dot if it is currently disconnected. The last
connection event reports, if available, the date of the last connection or disconnection.</p><p>A filter section is present on the side of the list to aid the search for specific devices,
filtering the list by device ID, name, connection status, or configured attributes.</p><h3 id="registering-a-device" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#registering-a-device" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Registering a device
</h3>
<p>From the Device list, new devices may be registered by clicking on the <strong>Register a new device</strong>
button which will take you to the registration page.</p><p>Here you can proceed with the registration of the device by:</p><ul><li>providing a device ID: either by generating a random ID or by specifying a <code class="inline">Name</code> and
<code class="inline">Namespace UUID</code> to generate the ID in a deterministic fashion.</li><li>optionally declaring the initial <em>introspection</em> of the device: this is an indication of the list
of interfaces that the device will use to exchange data.</li></ul><p>You can learn more about Devices and the registration process in their
<a href="035-register_device.html">documentation's section</a>.</p><h3 id="device-status-and-details" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#device-status-and-details" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Device status and details
</h3>
<p>From the Device list, you can select a device to navigate to its dedicated page.</p><p>Here you can review and manage different info about your device.</p><h4>Device Info</h4><ul><li><strong>Device Info</strong>: displays info such as the device ID and the device Name alias, if set. It reports
whether the device is currently connected or disconnected, or if it was never connected. From this
section you can also momentarily <strong>Inhibit credentials</strong> for the device, preventing it to obtain
access to Astarte; or you can directly <strong>Wipe credential secret</strong> of the device, a permanent
action which will require to register the device again to have a new Credential Secret.</li><li><strong>Aliases</strong>: where you can manage custom aliases for the device. Note that setting a <code class="inline">name</code> alias
will provide a name for the device.</li><li><strong>Attributes</strong>: a dedicated section to attach arbitrary info to the device, in a key-value form.</li><li><strong>Groups</strong>: where you can review and manage the Groups the device belongs to.</li><li><strong>Interfaces</strong>: a list of all currently and previously used interfaces. Clicking on an interface's
name will load a dedicated page to review data exchanged by the device through that interface.</li><li><strong>Stats</strong>: a rundown on exchanged data via different interfaces. Here you can review, in both
visual and numeric form, the quantity of bytes and messages the device is exchanging over each
interface. This way you can always know at a glance which interfaces are the busiest and how
chatty your device is.</li><li><strong>Status Events</strong>: here is info collected by Astarte regarding the IP addresses involved in the
connections of the device to Astarte, the dates of first registration and credentials request, and
the dates of last connection and disconnection, if available.</li><li><strong>Live Events</strong>: a section that reports live events regarding the device. It makes use of
<a href="052-using_channels.html">Astarte Channels</a> and displays the connections, exchanged data, and
errors of the device, as they happen in real-time.</li></ul><h2 id="groups" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#groups" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Groups
</h2>
<p><a href="065-managing-groups.html">Groups</a> are logical collections of devices to ease the management and
querying of devices.</p><p>You can navigate to this section thanks to the side menu of the Dashboard. A list of all existing
groups is displayed, together with the number of total and connected devices for each group.</p><h3 id="creating-a-group" class="section-heading">

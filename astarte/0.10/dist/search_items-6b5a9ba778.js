Astarte is a collection of components written in Elixir meant to orchestrate and pilot a number of 3rd party components. These components include: One or more ingresses (the most popular implementation being an MQTT broker) An AMQP broker for handling messages and queues between Astarte's services A Cassandra-like Database for ingesting and retrieving data (currently Cassandra and ScyllaDB are both supported) These components are never directly exposed to Astarte's end user, who requires no knowledge whatsoever of the mentioned frameworks - they are rather orchestrated and managed directly by Astarte's services. It is, however, responsability of Astarte's administrators to make sure these services are made available the way they are meant to. For more details on this topic and, in general, on how to deal with Astarte's installation and maintenance, please refer to the Administrator Guide .","ref":"001-intro_architecture.html","title":"Introduction","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Design Principles Astarte has a strongly opinionated design aimed at the generic IoT / data-driven use case.

As such, as long as a service conforms with the policies defined by the queues, it is possible to extend Astarte in virtually any language that can deliver a compliant AMQP client.","ref":"010-design_principles.html#amqp-as-internal-api-mechanism","title":"Design Principles - AMQP as internal API mechanism","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Astarte identifies each device with a 128 bit Device ID which has to be unique within its Realm. As a best practice, it is advised to generate such an ID from hardware unique IDs or using dedicated hardware modules, to make it consistent across device reflashes. It is advised to use a cryptographic hash function (such as sha256) when generating it using a software module. Astarte will use URL encoded base64 (without padding) strings like V_zv6ThCCtXWveQ8mPjsKg in its representation. This detail is relevant not only for identifying and querying the device, but also for the Pairing mechanism , as a device's credentials are associated to its Device ID. Note: currently, Astarte accepts Device IDs longer than 128 bit, which are then truncated to 128 bit internally. This behaviour exists for compatibility reasons but it's not supported and will likely change in future releases - hence, refrain from using anything which is not a 128-bit Device ID. Note: As much as Device IDs should effectively be unique per-realm and this configuration will always be supported, some future optional optimizations might be available on top of the assumption that Device IDs are globally unique to an Astarte installation. Given the Device ID format has a 2&lt;sup&gt;-128&lt;/sup&gt; chance of collision, it is safe to assume that as long as best practices for Device ID generation are followed, Device IDs will always be globally unique.","ref":"010-design_principles.html#device-id","title":"Design Principles - Device ID","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Astarte assumes devices are capable of exchanging data over a transport/protocol supporting SSL/TLS (e.g.: MQTT). This is a strong requirement, as Astarte identifies devices through client SSL certificates when it comes to data exchange. Each transport implementation must be capable of mapping interfaces and out-of-band messages on top of it. Astarte itself does not care about the implementation detail of the transport itself, as the transport is in charge of converting its input to an AMQP message following Astarte's internal API specification. Astarte's official reference and recommended design is MQTT using VerneMQ and its Astarte plugin. Device SDK and code generation Device SDKs can take advantage of the interface design to dynamically generate code for exchanging data with Astarte. This way, developers using Device SDKs are spared from knowing details about the underlying transports and protocols, and can use a data-driven API. However, there are some limitations and requirements: The SDK requires SSL support - Astarte does not allow exchanging data over unencrypted channels and its design builds on the assumption that everything runs on top of SSL. If your device isn't capable of SSL, you are probably looking for Gateway support in Astarte. As much as the SDK can implement virtually any transport protocol, it is required that the SDK supports at least HTTP(s) for Pairing.","ref":"010-design_principles.html#device-interaction","title":"Design Principles - Device interaction","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Astarte is natively multitenant through the concept of Realms. Each Realm is a logical portion of Astarte, and usually represents an organization or, in general, a set of devices physically/logically isolated. Realms build upon the concept of keyspaces in Cassandra. Each Realm has its very own keyspace and has no shared data with other Realms. In fact, it is even possible to have a dedicated Cassandra cluster for a single realm in complex installations.","ref":"010-design_principles.html#realms-and-multitenancy","title":"Design Principles - Realms and multitenancy","type":"extras"},{"doc":"In Astarte, transports are given the task to deliver messages in a well-known AMQP structure. The ordering of such messages is then preserved on a set of criterias: There is no such thing as &quot;in-order&quot; among devices. A message X sent to device A can be processed after a message Y sent to device B even if Y was ingested in the AMQP queue before X. This is intentional and by design. All messages to a specific device A are always guaranteed to be processed in the very same order of the transport ingestion. Ordering is not dependent on the message timestamp, which can be set by different sources (depending on the interface's definition of timestamp). For example, interface A has explicit timestamping while interface B doesn't. Message X from A has an earlier timestamp than message Y from B, but if message Y has been ingested before X, Y will be processed before X regardless. Responsibility of message ordering before entering AMQP is entirely up to the transport, and different transports might have different behaviors when it comes to message ordering. Astarte provides this guarantee right after the transport itself. Message ordering concerns only pipelines in the DUP , including but not limited to data ingestion in the Database and Simple Triggers.","ref":"010-design_principles.html#message-ordering","title":"Design Principles - Message Ordering","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Triggers are rules which are &quot;triggered&quot; whenever one or more conditions are satisfied.

They are not to be intended as OOP interfaces, but rather as the following definition: In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. In Astarte each interface has an owner, can represent either a continuous data stream or a snapshot of a set of properties, and can be either aggregated into an object or be an independent set of individual members. If you are already familiar with interface's basic concepts, you might want to jump directly to the Interface Schema .","ref":"030-interface.html","title":"Interfaces","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Interfaces are versioned, each interface having both a major version and a minor version number. The concept behind these two version numbers mimics Semantic Versioning : arbitrary changes can happen exclusively between different major versions (e.g. removing members, changing types, etc...), whereas minor versions allow incremental additive changes only (e.g. adding members). Several different major versions of the same interface can coexist at the same time in Astarte, although a Device can hold only a single version of an interface at a time (even though interfaces can be updated over time).

Every Device in Astarte can have any number of interfaces of any different types. Datastream datastream represents a mutable, ordered stream of data, with no concept of persistent state or synchronization. As a rule of thumb, datastream interfaces should be used when dealing with values such as sensor samples, commands and events. datastream are stored as time series in the database, making them suitable for time span filtering and any other common time series operation, and they are not idempotent in the REST API semantics. Due to their nature, datastream interfaces have a number of additional properties which fine tune their behavior. Properties properties represent a persistent, stateful, synchronized state with no concept of history or timestamping. properties are useful, for example, when dealing with settings, states or policies/rules. properties are stored in a key-value fashion, and grouped according to their interface, and they are idempotent in the REST API semantics. Rather than being able to act on a stream like in the datastream case, properties can be retrieved, or can be used as a trigger whenever they change. Values in a properties interface can be unset (or deleted according to the http jargon): to allow such a thing, the interface must have its allow_unset property set to true .

Mappings are designed around REST controller semantics: each mapping describes an endpoint which is resolved to a path, it is strongly typed, and can have additional options. Just like in REST controllers, Endpoints can be parametrized to build REST-like collection and trees. Parameters are identified by %{parameterName} , with each endpoint supporting any number of parameters (see Limitations ). This is how a parametrized mapping looks like: [ ... ] &quot;mappings&quot; : [ { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/%{itemIndex}/value&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;integer&quot; , &quot;reliability&quot; : &quot;unique&quot; , &quot;retention&quot; : &quot;discard&quot; } , [ ... ] In this example, /0/value , /1/value or /test/value all map to a valid endpoint, while /te/st/value can't be resolved by any endpoint. Supported data types The following types are supported: double : A double-precision floating-point format as specified by binary64, by the IEEE 754 standard integer : A signed 32 bit integer. boolean : Either true or false , adhering to JSON boolean type. longinteger : A signed 64 bit integer (please note that longinteger is represented as a string by default in JSON-based APIs.). string : An UTF-8 string. binaryblob : An arbitrary sequence of any byte that should be shorter than 1 MiB. ( binaryblob is represented as a base64 string by default in JSON-based APIs.). datetime : A UTC timestamp, internally represented as milliseconds since 1st Jan 1970 using a signed 64 bits integer. ( datetime is represented as an ISO 8601 string by default in JSON based APIs.) doublearray , integerarray , booleanarray , longintegerarray , stringarray , binaryblobarray , datetimearray : A list of values, represented as a JSON Array. Arrays can have up to 32768 items, must be shorter than 1MiB, and each item must be shorter than 64KiB. In particular, text fields must be shorter than 32000 characters. Limitations A valid interface must resolve a path univocally to a single endpoint. Take the following example: [ ... ] &quot;mappings&quot; : [ { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/%{itemIndex}/value&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;integer&quot; } , { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/myPath/value&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;integer&quot; } , [ ... ] In such a case, the interface isn't valid and is rejected, due to the fact that path /myPath/value is ambiguous and could be resolved to two different endpoints. Any endpoint configuration must not generate paths that are prefix of other paths, for this reason the following example is also invalid: [ ... ] &quot;mappings&quot; : [ { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/some/thing&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;integer&quot; } , { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/some/%{param}/value&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;integer&quot; } , [ ... ] In case the interface's aggregation is object , additional restrictions apply. Endpoints in the same interface must all have the same depth, and the same number of parameters. If the interface is parametrized, every endpoint must have the same parameter name at the same level. This is an example of a valid aggregated interface mapping: [ ... ] &quot;mappings&quot; : [ { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/%{itemIndex}/value&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;integer&quot; } , { &quot;endpoint&quot; : &quot;/%{itemIndex}/otherValue&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;string&quot; } , [ ... ]","ref":"030-interface.html#mappings","title":"Interfaces - Mappings","type":"extras"},{"doc":"In a real world scenario, such as an array of sensors, there are usually two main cases. A sensor might have one or more independent values which are sampled individually and sent whenever they become available independently. Or a sensor might sample at the same time a number of values, which might as well have some form of correlation. In Astarte, this concept is mapped to interface aggregation . In case aggregation is individual , each mapping is treated as an independent value and is managed individually. In case aggregation is object , Astarte expects the owner to send all of the interface's mappings at the same time, packed in a single message. In this case, all of the mappings share some core properties such as the timestamp. Aggregation is a powerful mechanism that can be used to map interfaces to real world &quot;objects&quot; .

NOTE: In case the interface is aggregated, overriding any additional properties at mapping level does not have any effect, and might cause a validation error. explicit_timestamp : By default, Astarte associates a timestamp to data whenever it is collected (or - when the message hits the data collection stage).

Otherwise, storing it into the bootloader's variables is a viable and safe alternative. Other options might be having a separate, isolated storage containing Credentials Secret . In general, Astarte SDK does not provide a streamlined mechanism for retrieving Credentials Secret as the storage detail is strongly dependent on the target hardware - device developers should implement the safest strategy which better complies with their policies. Tuning devices for security is out of the scope of this guide, however it is advised to make sure only Astarte SDK has access to Credentials Secret .","ref":"050-pairing_mechanism.html#credentials-secret-vs-transport-credentials","title":"Pairing Mechanism - Credentials Secret vs. Transport Credentials","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Whenever possible, Transports are advised to implement their Authentication through the use of SSL certificates and a certificate authority by using Mutual Authentication , to ensure identities of the endpoint and the client are well-known to each other - this is especially the case with Astarte's MQTT Protocol on top of VerneMQ Transport. In this case, Transport Credentials are a SSL Certificate, and Pairing will interact with a Certificate Authority. The certificate rotates depending on the emission policy of the CA and can be renewed and invalidated countless times over the device lifecycle. The Certificate is a transient, asymmetric, device-specific, non-critical Transport Credential which can be in turn used to authenticate against the chosen Transport. In this case, Transports should have no knowledge nor access to secrets or Authorization details: they rather have to comply with the configured CA and the certificate parsing, as the Certificate contains all needed information for Authorization as well. Mutual SSL Authentication Flow Side note: the Transport usually bears the public certificate of the CA, and actually interacts with the CA itself only if it exposes an OCSP endpoint and the Transport is capable of understanding it. In case the CA exposes a CRL, the Transport just makes sure to update its CRL from the CA every once in a while. In both cases, Transport's only interaction with the CA is the configuration of its SSL endpoint. Certificate Authority Pairing is designed to interact with an abstract certificate authority, given this authority is capable of: Emitting SSL Certificates with a custom CN (this is important in the Transport authentication flow) Revoking emitted certificates and exposing CRL/OCSP revocation information and is accessible from a 3rd party (e.g. from a REST API). By default, Astarte supports Cloudflare's CFSSL , and also provides a minimal installation in its default deploy scripts. For bigger installations, especially in terms of number of connected devices, it is strongly advised to use a dedicated CFSSL installation. Also, Astarte Enterprise provides a number of additional features including support for other external CAs. Certificate flow During the Pairing flow, the device must generate autonomously a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) which will be in turn relayed by Pairing to the configured Certificate Authority. Pairing will also provide the Certificate Authority with a custom CN, which maps to &lt;realm&gt;/&lt;device id&gt; . The CA must ensure the signed certificate carries this information, as it will be used by the Transport to authenticate the caller inside Astarte. Pairing, in fact, will also perform sanity checks over the signed certificate and reject it in case the CA fails to comply.","ref":"050-pairing_mechanism.html#using-ssl-certificates-as-transport-credentials","title":"Pairing Mechanism - Using SSL Certificates as Transport Credentials","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Agents are realm-level entities capable of registering a device into Astarte. Agents are a core concept in the Pairing mechanism, as no Device can request its Transport Credentials nor be authenticated against any Transport unless an Agent previously gave its consent and delivered its Credentials Secret . The recommended configuration includes an authenticated Agent in a trusted physical environment (e.g.: the distribution facility of the device) which guarantees an isolated and safe routine for generating Credentials Secret . However, such a setup might not always be possible, and Astarte's SDK has an On Board Agent concept to allow a simpler registration procedure. On Board Agent In the On Board Agent use case, the device is preloaded with an Agent Key , a shared secret which is not tied to a specific Device in the realm . In fact, this secret is usually the same for all Devices in the same realm. This secret will be used only once, upon the device's first interaction with Astarte (Registration), and can be safely discarded afterwards. This approach largely simplifies the deploy procedure, but leaves every device with a secret which, if retrieved, can allow an entity to register an arbitrary Device in the realm. If following the On Board Agent approach, it is advised to store the Agent Key in a safe area inside the device and delete it after retrieving a Credentials Secret (some OTPs allow this configuration).","ref":"050-pairing_mechanism.html#agents","title":"Pairing Mechanism - Agents","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Once a device obtains its Transport Credentials , it is then capable of connecting to the Transport the credentials were forged for.

For this very reason, we encourage users to be extremely cautious when using 3rd party Transports which have not been verified and hardly tested, especially when it comes to the Client Authentication stage. Even though there are valid use cases where Mutual Authentication is not usable, Transports are advised to stick to Mutual SSL Authentication where possible.

Given that Astarte's data access APIs match the devices' topology like a tree, declaring the authorization in terms of path whitelisting gives enough flexibility to give each user the correct permissions without limitations. As said, Astarte does not have the concept of user, and neither has a durable storage which tracks permissions. As such, it expects the authorization information to be inside the token, which is the only entity Astarte can trust - given it has been verified and authenticated through its signature. Paths are given in form of a set of Perl-like Regular Expressions , and on a per-API basis. This means that each API endpoint (app, realm, etc...) has its own regular expression which defines what the user can do. Moreover, each HTTP verb in an API endpoint (e.g.: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) can have its own regular expression, to fine-grain permissions on each path. Note: given Astarte's interface are either read only or write only, HTTP verb fine-graining in AppEngine API is mostly useful for preventing a user from deleting a consumer Datastream even though it has write access to it. Most of the time, using only a single regular expression with no verb fine-graining works. Examples of valid regular expressions on AppEngine API are: POST::devices/.*/interfaces/com\\\\.my\\\\.interface/.* : Allows to set individual values on the com.my.interface interface on any individual device in the realm. .*::.*/interfaces/com\\\\.my\\\\.monitoring\\\\.interface.* : Allows to get/set/delete either the aggregate or the individual values of the com.my.monitoring.interface interface on any device or device aggregation in the realm. .*::devices/j0zbvbQp9ZNnanwvh4uOCw.* : Allows every operation on device j0zbvbQp9ZNnanwvh4uOCw GET::devices/[a-zA-Z0-9-_]* : Allows to get every individual device's status, but denies access to any additional information/operation on them. Examples of valid regular expressions on Realm Management API are: POST::interfaces\\/.* : Allows installing new interfaces in the realm. GET::interfaces\\/.* : Allows inspecting every interface in the realm. PUT::interfaces\\/.*\\/0 : Allows updating all draft interfaces in the realm. Other valid examples are: .*::.* : Allows any operation on the given API. Both verb and path regular expressions are implicitly delimited by adding ^ before and $ after the regular expression string. For example, if you use GET::interfaces as regular expression in Realm Management API, the path will be matched against ^GET$ and the path will be matched against ^interfaces$ . This way the only operation allowed will be listing all the interfaces, while all operation on interfaces/ subpaths will be denied. Token claims and formats Authorization regular expressions have to be contained in the token's claims. Only the JWT case will be considered given it is the primary currency Astarte supports. Every claim is an array of regular expressions, which act as a logical OR. A similar behavior could be of course achieved (and might be more efficient) with a singular regular expression, but for the sake of readability and simplicity it is allowed nonetheless. Of course, keeping the authorization claims simple and pragmatic helps in terms of performance. Supported token claims are: a_aea : Defines the regular expressions for AppEngine API a_rma : Defines the regular expressions for Realm Management API a_hka : Defines the regular expressions for Housekeeping API a_pa : Defines the regular expressions for Pairing API a_ch : Defines the regular expressions for Channels Of course, claims are considered only after a successful token verification. This means that the claim will be processed only if the caller is authenticated against the correct authentication realm - this is especially the case for what concerns Housekeeping, which has a dedicated Authentication realm not tied to any Astarte realms. An example of a valid token claim is: { &quot;a_aea&quot;: [&quot;GET::devices/[a-zA-Z0-9-_]*&quot;, &quot;.*::.*/interfaces/com\\\\.my\\\\.monitoring\\\\.interface.*&quot;, &quot;.*::devices/j0zbvbQp9ZNnanwvh4uOCw.*&quot;], &quot;a_rma&quot;: [&quot;GET::.*&quot;] } Which allows very specific permissions on AppEngine API, and a &quot;read all&quot; on Realm Management API. The client by default has no permission to do anything: as such, if a token is missing a claim it is simply assumed that the client isn't authorized to access that specific API. However, keeping in mind that Astarte has no concept of User, it is also true that your authentication backend might choose to emit a different token with only a subset of its real permissions to keep claims and regular expressions as pragmatic as possible. See Granular Claims in Best Practices for more details on this.

However, virtually any token-based system can be used as an auth framework for Astarte. The main purpose of Astarte's design, however, is to keep things simple for everyone. Putting up a full-fledged SSO dedicated to Astarte is beyond the scope of this documentation, and we favor the use case where an existing SSO infrastructure is integrated with Astarte, rather than built ad-hoc. For simple use cases and instant satisfaction, it is strongly advised to use a simpler solution, such as a dedicated OAuth server. Almost all popular languages and frameworks provide great projects which can spin up an OAuth2 server + user management in a matter of hours, from Elixir/Phoenix to Java/Spring to Go .

In most production cases, Astarte will be part of a larger SSO infrastructure being one of the clients (this is especially true for OAuth). Among best practices, emitting short-lived tokens should always be considered, but depending on the use case, the authentication pipeline can be further tuned to address a number of potential issues. Token exchange OAuth, like other protocols supports the concept of a Token Exchange . Consider a web dashboard with a logged in user. The user will, most likely, have a token which is used by its frontend to call upon the backend/APIs of the web dashboard. For the sake of simplicity, one might include in this token the adequate claims to give the user access to Astarte, but this might not be desirable for a number of reasons outlined above. Token exchange, if supported by your SSO, provides a great way to work around this: whenever the backend or the frontend requires access to Astarte, it can invoke the token exchange mechanism of the SSO to generate a short lived token for the API call from the original authentication, which can then be used even as a single shot access mechanism. Granular claims The token exchange approach can be efficiently paired with a mechanism of granular claims. Consider the use case above, and let's assume the frontend needs direct, frequent access to Astarte's APIs. Exchanging tokens too many times might put a burden on the SSO and might become impractical. However, Astarte decouples entirely authentication and authorization - that means, if two subsequent (valid) tokens which represent the same identity have substantially different claims, it doesn't care. This is intentional, as it allows for a much more efficient pattern: the token used by an hypotetical frontend can have a subset of the user's claims - for example, allowing him to read data from its devices, whereas token exchange can be used whenever more specific operations should be performed - for example, sending some commands or data to devices. This also addresses the objection that regular expressions can grow big or quite complicated in case users need a large number of very granular permissions. In such complex cases, the SSO can be tuned to give out only a subset of claims depending on the user's operation. Token revocation Token revocation isn't natively supported in Astarte for two reason: the first one is performance, as keeping a revocation list is expensive in many regards. The second is the fact that the revocation list is, most of the time, SSO specific, and a dedicated SSO integration would be required. Rather than token revocation, a better practice is to make sure every emitted token has a short enough lifetime. However, it is possible to extend Astarte's authorization stage to support revocation, even though there are no plans to provide upstream support for that. Changing a Realm's validation mean Over the lifetime of a cluster, it might be necessary to change a realm's validation mean for the most diverse reasons. By design, validation means are meant to be long lived, and changing them is supposed to be an extraordinary operation. Astarte supports only one validation mean at a time. When the validation mean is changed, all tokens emitted which could be validated with the previous mean become invalid. It is also possible that there might be a delay between the request of a validation mean change and its actuation. This means during this grace period tokens will be validated against the previously configured mean. As such, it is advised to treat a validation mean change as a maintenance operation for the realm. More details can be found in the Administrator Guide.","ref":"070-auth.html#best-practices","title":"Authentication and Authorization - Best practices","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Astarte MQTT v1 Protocol Astarte MQTT v1 Protocol allows communication between Astarte and devices.

MQTT doesn't mandate the data serialization format, so any application might implement its own format. Data serialization might be a tricky task and protocols might be hard to design, Astarte MQTT takes care of this and provides a higher level protocol which abstracts this detail from the end user. Astarte MQTT v1 Protocol builds upon MQTT v3.1.1 itself, BSON (Binary JSON, version 1.1) serialized payloads and on optional zlib deflate. All communications are ordered and asynchronous. A protocol reference implementation is provided with an Astarte SDK, however developers might implement it from scratch using 3rd party libraries with their favourite languages: all formats and protocols described here are open and well documented. Last but not least Astarte doesn't mandate this protocol, and a different one can be used with a different transport.","ref":"080-mqtt-v1-protocol.html","title":"Astarte MQTT v1 Protocol","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Astarte MQTT v1 Protocol relies on few well known reserved topics.

Astarte is an Open Source IoT platform focused on Data management. It takes care of everything from collecting data from devices to delivering data to end-user applications. To achieve such a thing, it uses a mixture of mechanisms and paradigm to store organized data, perform live queries. This guide focuses on daily operations for Astarte users and integrators. It goes through fundamental operations such as setting up triggers, querying APIs, integrating 3rd party applications and more. The user guide starts from the assumption that the reader is interacting with one or more well-known realms , and throughout the manual the assumption is that we're always operating inside a test realm, unless otherwise specified. Setting up realms is out of the scope of this guide, also because it's not a task the average user has to deal with. Please refer to the dedicated chapter of the Administrator manual to learn more about this specific topic.

Devices are the bottom end, and represent your IoT fleet. They can access Astarte only through a Transport, they are defined by a set of Interfaces which, in turn, also define on a very granular level which kind of data they can exchange. By design, they can't access any resource which isn't their own: such a behavior can be configured using Astarte as a middleman to act as a secure Gateway. Users are actual users, applications or anything else which needs to interact directly with Astarte. They are bound to a realm, and can virtually access any resource in that realm given they're authorized to do so. Users can also manage triggers and perform maintenance activity on the Realm.","ref":"010-interacting_with_astarte.html","title":"Interacting with Astarte","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Devices interact with Astarte through their associated Transport. In this guide, we'll assume the Transport is MQTT/VerneMQ as per Astarte's defaults. However, rather than implementing the whole Astarte protocol over MQTT, it is usually a better idea to rely on one of Astarte's SDKs . Authentication/Pairing Depending on how you plan on implementing Astarte's pairing mechanism , your devices might need an Agent for their first authentication or not. However, once they retrieve their Credentials Secret, they can implement Astarte's standard pairing routine to rotate their SSL certificate for accessing the transport. In the most likely scenario in which you are using one of Astarte's SDKs, the SDK takes care of the whole pairing routine under the hood and, depending on your agent implementation, you just need to feed the SDK with either the Credentials Secret or the Agent Key. Exchanging data As per Astarte's protocol specification, data is exchanged based on the device's introspection. The device will be able to publish data on the transport on device interfaces, and receive data on server interfaces. In the MQTT case, the device will subscribe to its server interfaces' topics, and publish on its device interfaces topics. Isolation and RBAC are guaranteed by the transport's ACL, which are usually orchestrated though a dedicated Astarte extension (as in the VerneMQ/MQTT case). Again, Astarte's SDK allows you to interact with your device interfaces directly without caring about the underlying protocol and exchange details.","ref":"010-interacting_with_astarte.html#interacting-with-a-device","title":"Interacting with Astarte - Interacting with a Device","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Astarte is mainly accessed through its APIs. Astarte's APIs are exposed through dedicated microservices (see Components ) and are meant both for configuration and for accessing data. There are two main sets of APIs we'll be using frequently: AppEngine API : This API is meant for querying/pushing data from/to devices. Realm Management API : This API is meant for configuring a target realm, and most notably for managing triggers. Authentication Authenticating against Astarte is out of the scope of this guide, especially due to the fact that Astarte does not manage authentication directly . We'll assume either the authentication isn't enabled, or that the user is always interacting with the APIs with a token with the following claims { &quot;a_aea&quot;: &quot;.*:.*&quot;, &quot;a_rma&quot;: &quot;.*:.*&quot; } Which represents a realm administrator. In real life use cases, you should always make sure to give out more granular permissions and to obtain the token in the right way from your authentication server. Accessing the APIs In a standard Astarte installation, AppEngine API and Realm Management API are usually accessible at app.api.&lt;your astarte domain&gt; and realm.api.&lt;your astarte domain&gt; respectively, or at api.&lt;your astarte domain&gt;/app and api.&lt;your astarte domain&gt;/realm .

As such, it is fundamental to spend enough time on finding the most correct Interface design for your use case, keeping in mind how your users will consume your data, what might change in the future, what is fundamental and what is optional, and more.","ref":"029-interface_design_guide.html","title":"Interface Design Guide","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Without going into deeper details on what concerns Astarte's DB internals, there are some considerations one should always keep in mind when designing interfaces. Querying an Interface is fast, querying across Interfaces is painful Astarte's data modeling is designed to optimize queries within a single interface. Querying across interfaces is supported, but might affect performances significantly, especially if done frequently and with complex queries. This is especially true for triggers, as they could be evaluated very frequently. In general, if you plan on having different mappings which are frequently queried altogether, or dependent on each other for several triggers, you might be better off in having them all in the same Interface. Aggregation makes a difference Aggregation is a powerful feature, which comes with price and benefits. Even though each series has only one timestamp for all values, it is also true that losing granularity for endpoints might cause storage of redundant data if only one of the aggregated mappings change value. Moreover, in terms of data modeling, Aggregated interfaces imply the creation of a dedicated Cassandra table. Having a lot of aggregated interfaces might end up putting additional pressure on the Cassandra Cluster in terms of memory and overall performance.

Once an interface has been installed in a Realm, it can't be uninstalled without performing manual operations on Astarte's DB, unless its major version number is 0 . This is a safety measure to prevent dangling data from appearing in the cluster. For this reason, when developing an Astarte-based interface, it is strongly advised to keep its major number to 0 to allow quick changes at the expense of data loss. Please note, however, that deleting a major 0 interface is possible if the Realm has no devices left declaring that specific interface in their introspection. This is done to avoid forever dangling data and potential consistency errors. This limitation might be lifted in the future through a mass-deletion mechanism, but there is no guarantee this will ever be done. It is advised to test new interfaces on a limited number of devices to ease operations.","ref":"030-manage_interfaces.html#interfaces-lifecycle","title":"Managing Interfaces - Interfaces lifecycle","type":"extras"},{"doc":"There is a clear difference between how Interfaces are managed in a Realm and its Devices (e.g.: the device Introspection). Whereas a Realm can have any number of versions of a single interface, a Device is allowed to expose in its introspection only a single, specific version of an Interface. In general, Realm interfaces are kept as a shared agreement between its entities, but when it comes to interacting with a Device, the Realm honors its introspection (as long as the Device declares interfaces the Realm is knowledgeable about). As such, installing an interface in a Realm is a completely safe and non-disruptive operation: by design, Devices aren't aware of which interfaces a Realm supports, and Realms don't impose any interface versioning on a Device.","ref":"030-manage_interfaces.html#realm-vs-device-interface-relationship","title":"Managing Interfaces - Realm vs. Device Interface relationship","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Due to how minor versions work, it is responsibility of the end user to prevent accidental data loss due to missing data.

Minor version bumps work great in case they represents additional, optional features which might be available on an arbitrarly large subset of Devices implementing that interface's major version, and are not necessary or fundamental for normal operations. If that is not the case, consider a major version update or a whole new interface instead.

This happens by design, as the liquid nature of a Device makes it possible for data to be stored in interfaces no longer present in its introspection. Astarte does not delete data unless requested explicitly: as such, data remains available inside its database, but potentially inaccessible through the cluster's APIs and standard mechanism. As of the current version, Astarte has no mechanism for retrieving and acting upon a device's dangling data - this is a limitation that will be lifted in future releases with additions to the current API. Interface major version change If a device upgrades one of its interfaces to a new major version, the previous interface is parked and its data remains dangling. Every API call, trigger, or reference to the interface will always target the major version declared in the introspection, regardless of the fact that a more recent version might have been installed in the realm. Interface deletion from device A device might arbitrarly decide to remove an interface from its introspection. In such a case, Astarte won't return any data and will consider all data previously pushed to said interface inaccessible.

Even though a Device usually represents the physical Device communicating with Astarte, they might as well be mapped to other entities, such as individual sensors or aggregated gateways. A Device always belongs to a Realm and is identified by a Device ID , which has to be unique at least within its Realm. Devices communicate with Astarte through Transports - in most installations, this means through an MQTT Broker (VerneMQ with Astarte's plugin). Before this happens, though, Devices must obtain credentials for accessing their Transport and, most of all, make themselves known to Astarte. This happens through the Registration process. In Astarte, Registering a device means obtaining an unique Credentials Secret (Registration Credentials), univocally associated to a Device ID, through a well-known workflow and pipeline. If you are not familiar with these concepts, please refer to Pairing Architecture to learn more about Pairing's workflow basics. The Credentials Secret can then be used by the Device for accessing Pairing API and getting information and Credentials for its Transport. As such, registration happens only once during a Device's lifecycle, and is a security-sensitive process. As such, this process is usually carried over (in production scenarios) through an Agent .","ref":"035-register_device.html","title":"Registering a Device","type":"extras"},{"doc":"An Agent 's purpose is to perform Registration on behalf of a Device. Agents should be the only components in your infrastructure with enough credentials to access Pairing's Agent APIs (as a rule of thumb, it is a bad idea to give access to Pairing API to anything which isn't an Agent). When setting up an Astarte project, it is fundamental to define beforehand how your Devices will be registered and hence where your Agent(s) will belong. There's two main ways for implementing an Agent, even though in production scenarios On Board Agents are strongly discouraged as they expose a single point of failure in terms of a Realm's whole fleet security. On Board Agent Please keep in mind that On Board Agents are not advised in production, as a single compromised device/token might compromise the Registration routine for your entire fleet. They should be used only in non-critical use cases or during testing and development. On Board Agents are provided as a feature by Astarte's SDK, and hide the detail of Device registration by integrating an Agent into the SDK itself. This allows to deliver the same credentials to each device belonging to a Realm. Of course, this also opens up a single point of failure in the whole fleet's security, as Credentials aren't tied to a specific device - as such, if compromised, they might allow an attacker to register an arbitrary device into a Realm, unless other policies prevent him from doing so. To create a On Board Agent, you simply need to emit a long-enough lived token from your Realm's private key with access to Pairing's Agent APIs . This token should then be delivered to your devices and provided to the SDK in order to carry over the Registration. The SDK will do this automatically and without any need for additional code, as long as you set the agentKey configuration key to a meaningful value, and no Credentials Secret has been set. 3rd Party Agent A more secure approach to the Registration process is having a 3rd Party agent. In such a case, an external component is in charge of requesting a Credentials Secret to Pairing and delivering it to the target Device. This approach has a number of benefits: in terms of Security, the Agent uses a short-lived token and can follow the Realm's authentication workflow just like any other application. For what concerns daily operations, the Agent can implement any arbitrary logic to make a decision on whether a Device should be registered or not. In such cases, Devices have an out-of-band communication mechanism with the Agent in which the Credentials are exchanged. Usually, these cases fall under two main categories: &quot;Local&quot; or &quot;Plant&quot; Agents In this scenario, devices are imprinted with their Credentials Secret in the production plant. The Device might not even be connected to the Internet, whereas the machine running the Agent has access to the target Astarte Cluster and adequate Credentials for Registration. Once the Agent acquires the Device ID of the Device which should be registered, it issues the request to Astarte's Pairing API and obtains the Device's Credentials Secret . At this stage, the Agent is in charge of delivering the Credentials Secret to the Device the way it sees fit. As a best practice, the Credentials Secret should then be saved to an OTP area or a dedicated secure storage in the device to prevent tampering or accidental loss. Even though this is arguably the most secure mechanism available for Registering a Device, it might not fit every use case as the Device will be irrevocabily assigned to a specific Astarte Cluster and a specific Realm in that Cluster before it even connects. &quot;Remote&quot; Agents If your use case demands more flexibility, Registering a Device in a plant might not fit your Device's lifecycle. This could be likely if, for example, Realm or Cluster assignment should be done dynamically once the Device reaches its final user. In this case, this role is usually delegated to an external web application acting as an Agent. In this case, it's up to the user setting up all mechanisms for delivering the Credentials Secret to the Device, which includes securing the communication channel. On the other hand, this allows an extremely flexible approach to Registration, which can be implemented through an entirely custom logic.","ref":"035-register_device.html#registration-agent","title":"Registering a Device - Registration Agent","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Credentials Secrets are meant to be immutable - as such, they should be handled with extreme care.

This is done to ensure the entire Registration process, including any kind of external custom logic of the Agents, has been carried over successfully, allowing a de-facto &quot;retry&quot; until there's certainty the Device has access to its Credentials Secret .

However, virtually any protocol can be integrated in Astarte by creating a corresponding Transport. Transports also define the authentication/authorization mechanism of their Devices.

Just make sure your Credentials Secret is passed as the apiKey configuration key, to allow the SDK to perform automatically the Pairing routine when needed. The SDK does a number of automated things under the hood. Its flow is: The SDK verifies if a SSL certificate for connecting to the broker is present. If it is, it attempts connecting to the Transport. If the Transport doesn't accept the connection due to an SSL error, it queries Pairing API about its certificate status. If Pairing API returns a problem with the certificate or, in general, the certificate isn't valid, the certificate is erased and the Pairing procedure begins. The SDK invokes Pairing API until it manages to obtain a valid Certificate for the Transport. The SDK considers a Device successfully paired when it has a valid certificate and manages to connect to the Transport. Once in this state, the Device can start exchanging data. Note: the Pairing procedure is secure as long as Pairing API is queried using HTTPS. Plain HTTP installations are vulnerable to a number of different attacks and should NEVER be used in production. Interfaces and Introspection A Device must have some installed interfaces to be capable of exchanging data. These interfaces must be made known to the SDK and installed in the Device's Realm, as previously explained . The SDK expects the user to provide a directory containing a set of valid interfaces. It then takes care of making Astarte aware of its registered interfaces through a process called Introspection. Introspection is a special control message in Astarte's protocol which makes Astarte aware of a list of Interfaces and relative versions which are installed on the Device. Again, Astarte's SDK, given a directory, is capable of performing the correct procedures for keeping Introspecting in sync correctly without any kind of user intervention. Astarte's SDK also takes care of updating a Device's Introspection if its interfaces change. Exchanging data When a Device connects successfully, it must then subscribe to its server Interfaces. The SDK takes care of this detail and exposes a higher level interface. For example, using the Qt5 SDK: { m_sdk = new AstarteDeviceSDK ( QStringLiteral ( &quot;/path/to/transport-astarte.conf&quot; ) , QStringLiteral ( &quot;/path/to/interfaces&quot; ) , deviceId ) ; connect ( m_sdk -&gt; init ( ) , &amp; Hemera :: Operation :: finished , this , &amp; AstarteStreamQt5Test :: checkInitResult ) ; connect ( m_sdk , &amp; AstarteDeviceSDK :: dataReceived , this , &amp; AstarteStreamQt5Test :: handleIncomingData ) ; } void AstarteStreamQt5Test :: handleIncomingData ( const QByteArray &amp; interface , const QByteArray &amp; path , const QVariant &amp; value ) { qDebug ( ) &lt;&lt; &quot;Received data, interface: &quot; &lt;&lt; interface &lt;&lt; &quot;path: &quot; &lt;&lt; path &lt;&lt; &quot;, value: &quot; &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; &quot;, Qt type name: &quot; &lt;&lt; value . typeName ( ) ; } Applications can simply connect to the handleIncomingData signal and have data correctly formatted and delivered as it runs through the transport. On the other hand, for sending data: m_sdk -&gt; sendData ( interface , path , value ) ; The SDK will check if data is coherent with its introspection, and send data onto the transport in the correct way. Reliability, retention and persistency in the SDK Astarte's SDK has an internal concept of persistency, depending on the behaviour defined in its installed Interfaces. The retention parameter, specifically, tells Astarte's SDK how hard it should try to send a specific message. In case the Transport is unreachable, the SDK might try to persist, either in memory or on disk, and send the message when the connection is available again. Please note that these parameters declared in Interfaces are to be considered on a best effort basis. In case your SDK does not support persistency or has persistency disabled, a number of warranties requested by an Interface might not be satisfied.

When GET ting, if you are querying an aggregate interface, make sure to query the interface itself rather than its mappings. When GET ting datastream , keep in mind that AppEngine's default behavior is to return a large as possible timeseries.","ref":"050-query_device.html#using-appengine-api","title":"Querying a Device - Using AppEngine API","type":"extras"},{"doc":"The Datastream case is significant, as it might be common to have a lot of values for each endpoint/interface. As such, returning all of them in a single API call is most of the times not desirable nor recommended. To avoid putting the cluster under excessive pressure, AppEngine API is configured with a hard cap on the maximum number of returned results for each single call, with a sane default of 10000 . Although this hard cap is entirely configurable, please be aware that AppEngine API is designed to process a lot of reasonably small requests in the shortest possible time, and hence is not optimised nor strongly tested against big requests . Make sure that AppEngine API has enough resources available to cope with the maximum dataset size. AppEngine API provides you with a variety of mechanisms to make retrieval and navigation of large data sets as smooth and efficient as possible. Limit Adding a limit=n to the URL query tells AppEngine to return no more than n results. This acts similarly to a LIMIT SQL statement, but, as it stands, it does not impose a hard limit on the whole retrieved dataset but on the amount of the results displayed by the API call - see Pagination and Time Windows for more details on this topic and the performance implications of different limits in queries. If the specified limit is beyond the hard cap, the query won't fail, but will return at most the amount set by the hard cap, without further warnings. Since/To/Since After Results can be limited to a specific time window. since and to can be set to a ISO 8601 valid timestamp to limit on an upper and lower bound the result set. This can also be combined with limit to make sure that no more than n results are returned. Also, since and to can as well be set independently to provide only an upper or lower bound. In case you're dealing with a very large dataset and you want to dump it, it is likely that you need to go beyond what a reasonable default limit looks like. In those cases, you can use the since_after query parameter to retrieve parameters within a time window. since_after slices the time window just like since does, but it does not include values matching the specified timestamp, if any. This is especially useful when paginating, to start right after a returned result. Pagination and time windows AppEngine API provides you automatically with a time window-based pagination. When GET ting a datastream , if more results are available beyond the chosen time window/limit, a links map will be provided, in JSON-API style, to allow the user to paginate the results accordingly using since_after . You can use limit to determine each page's size. When specifying a valid limit , the links will keep the page size consistent over the next calls. However, limit should be used wisely to lower the pressure on the cluster. Each API call maps to a query that, no matter how efficient, has a computational cost. A few mid-sized queries should always be preferred over a large amount of smaller queries. Given your cluster is configured correctly, limit should be omitted in most cases when paginating, and you should rather trust your cluster's hard cap to be the sweet spot in efficiency and cluster pressure. Downsampling Especially when plotting graphs, retrieving all points in a time series isn't desirable. Astarte provides you with an implementation of the LTTB Downsampling Algorithm , which is used to return only a fixed number of samples from a time series. When setting downsample_to=n , AppEngine will return a maximum of n results, which are the most significant over the considered time series according to the algorithm. Due to how LTTB works, downsample_to must be &gt;2 , as the algorithm will return the two ends of the considered value bucket, and n-2 values which are the picked samples. Please refer to the LTTB implementation used by Astarte to learn more about how this algorithm affects samples and its limitations. downsample_to=x can be used in conjunction with other query parameters, including limit=y . When doing so, Astarte will downsample to x samples the dataset composed of the last y values. Every feature previously outlined is in fact available with downsampling, including pagination - bear in mind, though, that for how the algorithm works, some options have drastically different semantic effects. Also, the hard cap has a very different meaning in downsampling. In this case, the hard cap applies to downsample_to instead of limit . limit can be an arbitrarly large amount of samples taken out of the DB, and can be used mainly to alleviate pressure in case of extremely large datasets which would require a lot of time for being processed by LTTB - even though, most of the time, you might want to define a time window to downsample instead. Astarte is also capable of downsampling aggregated interfaces, as long as a downsample_key is specified, which has to match the last token of an endpoint of the queried interface (i.e. in case the interface has a /%{id}/myValue mapping which should be used as the downsample_key , you should specify downsample_key=myValue in the query). When doing so, the aggregate will be downsampled using the chosen endpoint value as the y axis value, whereas its other endpoints will be disregarded when applying the algorithm. Please note that, no matter what downsample_key is used, a sample will be composed by the whole aggregation. If there is no way an interface can be downsampled (this is true, for example, if no downsample_key has been specified for aggregations , or for types such as strings ), AppEngine API will return a 4xx error. In general, downsampling is a powerful mechanism with a lot of limitations which really shines when plotting.

There is no restriction to which events a user sees - if he is authorized to enter in a room, he will be capable of seeing all events flowing in. More granular permissions can be done simply by creating more rooms in which different triggers will be installed. The JOIN verb has the following semantic: JOIN::&lt;regex&gt; , where regex matches a room name (the room name is what follows rooms:&lt;realm&gt;: - the realm is implicit in the context of the authorization token). For example, a user authorized with the JOIN::test.* claim in the test realm will be able to join, for example, rooms:test:testthis , rooms:test:testme , rooms:test:test .

This guide is great if you want to take Astarte for a spin, or if you want to use an isolated instance for development. You will need a machine with at least 4GB of RAM (mainly due to Cassandra), with Docker , cfssl , Python 3 and OpenSSL installed. You will need the PyJWT Python module for generating JWT tokens for Astarte, which you can install either via pip3 ( pip3 install PyJWT ) or using your distribution's packages (e.g. apt-get install python3-jwt on Debian based distributions).

It includes a tunable Docker Compose which brings up Astarte and every companion service needed for it to work. To do so, simply clone Astarte's main repository and use its scripts to bring it up: $ git clone https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte.git &amp;&amp; cd astarte $ ./generate-compose-files.sh $ docker-compose up -d generate-compose-files.sh will generate a root CA for devices, a key pair for Housekeeping, and a self-signed certificate for the broker (note: this is a really bad idea in production). You can tune the compose file further to use legitimate certificates and custom keys, but this is out of the scope of this tutorial. Compose might take some time to bring everything up, but usually within a minute from the containers creation Astarte will be ready. Compose will forward the following ports to your machine: 4000 : Realm Management API 4001 : Housekeeping API 4002 : AppEngine API 4003 : Pairing API 8883 : MQTTS 1885 : MQTT with Proxy Protocol for SSL termination (won't be used) 80 : Let's Encrypt verification (won't be used) This example won't use Let's Encrypt with VerneMQ - in case binding to port 80 is a problem to you, you can comment it out in docker-compose.yml without affecting any functionality. To check everything went fine, use docker ps to verify relevant containers are up: Astarte itself, VerneMQ, PostgreSQL (used by CFSSL), CFSSL, RabbitMQ and Cassandra should be now running on your system. If any of them isn't up and running, docker ps -a should show it stopped or failed. In those cases, it is advised to issue docker-compose up -d again to fix potential temporary failures.","ref":"010-astarte_in_5_minutes.html#install-astarte","title":"Astarte in 5 minutes - Install Astarte","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Now that we have our instance up and running, we can start setting up a Realm for our device. We'll call our Realm test . Given we have no SSO or Authentication mechanism set up, we're just going to generate a public key to sign our JWTs with. You can create one with OpenSSL: $ openssl genrsa -out test_realm.key 4096 $ openssl rsa -in test_realm.key -pubout -outform PEM -out test_realm.key.pub $ awk '{printf &quot;%s\\\\n&quot;, $0}' test_realm.key.pub &gt; test_realm.key.pub.api Also, we will need a JWT token to authenticate against Housekeeping. generate-compose-files.sh created a public key automatically, which is in compose/astarte-keys/housekeeping.pub . To generate a JWT token for authorizing our calls, we will use the handy generate-astarte-credentials utility in Astarte's repository, which can also be easily inlined into cURL. Use cURL to invoke Housekeeping API for creating a new Realm: $ curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/v1/realms -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $(./generate-astarte-credentials -t housekeeping -p compose/astarte-keys/housekeeping.key)&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d &quot;{\\&quot;data\\&quot;:{\\&quot;realm_name\\&quot;: \\&quot;test\\&quot;, \\&quot;jwt_public_key_pem\\&quot;: \\&quot;$(cat test_realm.key.pub.api)\\&quot;}}&quot; This creates a test realm, which should be ready to be used almost immediately. To ensure your realm is available and ready, check if it exists in Astarte by issuing: $ curl -X GET http://localhost:4001/v1/realms -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $(./generate-astarte-credentials -t housekeeping -p compose/astarte-keys/housekeeping.key)&quot;","ref":"010-astarte_in_5_minutes.html#create-a-realm","title":"Astarte in 5 minutes - Create a Realm","type":"extras"},{"doc":"We will use Astarte's Qt5 Stream Generator to feed data into Astarte.

This will send a POST to a URL of our choice every time the value generated by stream_test is above 0.6. Due to how triggers work, it is fundamental to install the trigger before a device connects.

If you don't, you can use Astarte's stream-qt5-test to emulate an Astarte device and generate a datastream . You can do this either on the same machine where you are running Astarte, or from another machine or device on the same network. Depending on what your client supports, you can either compile stream-qt5-test (this will take some more time), or you can use a ready to use Docker container to launch it. Docker is the easiest and painless way, but this guide will cover both methods. Using a container for stream-qt5-test Astarte's stream-qt5-test can be pulled from Docker Hub with: $ docker pull astarte/astarte-stream-qt5-test:0.10 Its most basic invocation (from your astarte repository tree) is: $ docker run --net=&quot;host&quot; -e &quot;DEVICE_ID=$(./generate-astarte-device-id)&quot; -e &quot;PAIRING_HOST=http://localhost:4003&quot; -e &quot;REALM=test&quot; -e &quot;AGENT_KEY=$(./generate-astarte-credentials -t pairing -p test_realm.key)&quot; -e &quot;IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=true&quot; astarte/astarte-stream-qt5-test:0.10 This will generate a random datastream from a brand new, random Device ID. You can tweak those parameters to whatever suits you better by having a look at the Dockerfile. You can spawn any number of instances you like, or you can have the same Device ID send longer streams of data by saving the container's persistency through a Docker Volume. If you wish to do so, simply add -v /persistency:&lt;your persistency path&gt; to your docker run invocation. Refer to stream-qt5-test README for more details on which variables can be passed to the container. Also, please note that the --net=&quot;host&quot; parameter is required to make localhost work. If this is not desirable, you can change PAIRING_HOST to an host reachable from within the container network. Obviously, that parameter isn't required if you're running the container on a different machine and PAIRING_HOST is pointing to a different URL.","ref":"010-astarte_in_5_minutes.html#stream-data","title":"Astarte in 5 minutes - Stream data","type":"extras"},{"doc":"If your target platform does not support running containers, you can build stream-qt5-test from source.

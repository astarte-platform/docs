# Getting started guide

All of the Astarte device SDKs are dependent on an Astarte instance running locally or remotely.
If you are new to Astarte and would like to quickly test one of our SDKs with an Astarte instance
on your local machine and network then follow our
[Astarte quick instance](astarte_quick_instance.md) guide to set up an Astarte instance from scratch.
Furthermore, we recommend reading the
[Astarte documentation](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/astarte/latest/001-intro_user.html) if you
want to dive deeper into the Astarte platform's inner workings.

Assuming a correctly configured Astarte instance is present, any of the Astarte device SDKs can be
used to interact with it.

Choose your favourite language and framework and follow our getting started guide:
